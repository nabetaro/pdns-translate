These tests can be used to verify standards compliance of PowerDNS and to
spot regressions.

Start PowerDNS with --no-shuffle for best results - the 'too-big-udp' test
fails otherwise, for cosmetical reasons.

Method of operation
-------------------

Each directory contains a command that, when executed, proces the 'cleandig'
output for the answer the nameserver sent. This output is stored in the file
'real_result', and compared to 'expected_result'. 

Then, 'diff -u' is run on those two files, and the output sent to the file
'diff'. If everything is as it should be, this diff file is empty, and
PowerDNS passed the test.

Caveats
-------

Optional features of the DNS standard can cause a difference to arrise. For
example, 'Bind 8' appears to fail on nearly all our tests, whereas it is in
compliance (except for one case).

Study the diff output to be sure if there is a problem.

How to run
----------

First make sure PowerDNS has access to the testing zone, which is in the
file 'testzone'. Use the 'zone2sql' tool to create sql and feed it to your
database. 

Set the 'nameserver' variable to the IP address of the nameserver you want
to test:

$ nameserver=127.0.0.1 ./runtests

Run PowerDNS as:

$ ../pdns/pdns_server --daemon=no --local-port=5300 --socket-dir=./  \
--no-shuffle --launch=gmysql --gmysql-dbname=pdnstest --gmysql-user=root \
--fancy-records --query-logging --send-root-referral --loglevel=9 \
--cache-ttl=0 --no-config

or:

$ ../pdns/pdns_server --daemon=no --local-port=5300 --socket-dir=./  \
--no-shuffle --launch=bind --bind-config=./named.conf                \
--fancy-records --query-logging --send-root-referral --loglevel=9    \
--cache-ttl=0 --no-config


The BIND backend can't do MBOXFW

Analysing results
-----------------

Failed tests appear in the file 'failed_tests', passed tests in
'passed_tests'. A complete log is in the file 'log'. Examine the 'diff'
files in all subdirectories to see what happened.
